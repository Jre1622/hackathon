# Also

Could use threeJS since vibeCoding is trending

# Main Concept: Interactive 3D Globe

- Create a spinning globe using ThreeJS as the main visual element
- As users scroll down, the globe zooms in to reveal more hackathon information
- Display sponsor and judge information as pins/markers on the globe showing their locations
- Clicking on pins reveals more details about sponsors/judges
- Implement smooth transitions between globe view and detailed information sections

# To DO COULD DO

add links to bolt.dev
add cool live twitter feeds etc..
Could have 'glitches' happen where the world tears open?
have the title typewriter into the screen and the globe glitch in after initial fake loading screen?
Could have bolt.dev slam down at the end
